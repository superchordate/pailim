# Pa'Ilim App

This application allows users to explore the dataset created by Carly Wayne. 

## Covariates

There are two types of covariates:

1. Time-varying: These come from `Covariates (2009-2023).csv` and are indexed by Date. They can be filtered by Month and Year and charts will show the daily average for a given period. 

2. District-varying: These come from `District Covariates (2009-2023).csv` and are indexed by Year. They can only be filtered by Year (not Month) and charts will show the average value across the selected years for each District.
