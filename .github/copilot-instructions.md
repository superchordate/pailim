# Custom instructions for Copilot

## Project Context

This project is a web application built with R Shiny.

## General Instructions

- Search the codebase for helpful examples and context.
- Make the minimal edit: one that reduces loading count, lines of code, and complexity. 
- Break out logic and UI into functions whenever it will help keep logic in one place and prevent files from getting too large.
- This project uses hcslim for charting with Highcharts in R Shiny. See .github\context\example-highcharts-hcslim-rshiny.R for an example, app\server\_init\hcslim.R for the hcslim functions.
- Use = instead of <- for assignment.
- Don't try to run the app, I'll test changes myself after you make and review/confirm them.
